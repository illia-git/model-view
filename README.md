# Model-View-Controller (MVC) Example Implementation

This repository provides an example implementation of the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern on both the server and client sides. MVC is a widely used design pattern in software development that separates an application into three interconnected components: the model, the view, and the controller. This structure helps in organizing code, improving maintainability, and promoting code reusability.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

- Git
- Node.js (v12 or higher)
- npm (Node Package Manager)

### Installation
Clone the repository to your local machine using Git:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/illia-git/model-view.git
```

### Frontend (Client Side)
Navigate to the client-side project directory:

```bash
  cd mvc-front
```

Install the project dependencies:

```bash
  npm install
```

Start the development server:

```bash
  npm run dev
```
### Backend (Server Side)
Navigate to the server-side project directory:

```bash
  cd mvc-node
```

Install the project dependencies:

```bash
  npm install
```

Start the server:

```bash
  npm run start
```
### Conclusion
By following the steps above, you can run the MVC example implementation on your local machine. Feel free to explore the code and customize it according to your needs. The separation of concerns provided by the MVC pattern will help you build scalable and maintainable applications.
